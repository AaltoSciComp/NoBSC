<section id="about-the-event">
<h3>About the event<a class="headerlink" href="#about-the-event" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This meetup is targeted towards people in local Scientific Computing
(SciComp)/Research computing/Research Software Engineer support teams,
for example university local HPC teams.  We work in local capacity and
are often overshadowed by the big national e-infrastructure providers
(CSC, EuroHPC, etc) in attention and funding, yet we are the ones “on
the ground” with the researchers.  What’s our place in the world?</p>
<p>We have our own unique challenges and opportunities.  This is a time
we can talk together and learn from each other.  (Others are of course
welcome.)  Maybe we can make a strategy for working together or
getting some national funding?</p>

<section id="who-should-join">
<h3>Who should join?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-should-join" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>For example, many of the teams that were part of the old Finnish Grid
Infrastructure at univerities or local partners of the CodeRefinery
collaboration.  Really, if you work with Aalto Scientific Computing
you are strongly invited and we’ll have some fun discussions.  If you
don’t, you are invited anyway.</p>
<p>We especially welcome people who support academic research through
computing and data expertise in universities and research
institutions, for example those in local HPC or RSE teams, cloud
computing, and other computing services for researchers. But everyone
is welcome: including Academic researchers, data managers, open
science experts and anyone interested in these topics.</p>

<h3>Hotels<a class="headerlink" href="#hotels" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>There are various hotels within easy walking distance. We don’t have any particular discounts. “Radison Blu Otaniemi” is the default location for university visitors. Other hotels in Helsinki downtown are fine also, the metro trip is 11 minutes (and costs ~3 euros).</p>
</section>
<section id="arrival">
<h3>Arrival<a class="headerlink" href="#arrival" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>tldr: Aalto University is at the “Aalto University” metro stop. An
“ABC” ticket manages the train from airport AND metro (and trams,
busses, etc).</p>
<p><strong>Air:</strong> Helsinki Airport. Between the airport and Aalto University,
plan for max 1.5 hours (less than one hour is possible if you are
efficient). From the airport, follow signs to the train station. Board
a train and immediately use a contactless payment card to buy an ABC
ticket at a card reader; this will get you all the way to the
university (see public transport). Take the first train that comes
(either way gets to downtown in about the same time). From the main
station, walk to the connected metro station. Take a metro to the stop
Aalto University (direction Tapiola or Kivenlahti), then continue in
section “public transport” below.</p>
<p><strong>Ferry:</strong> From Tallinn or Stockholm, there are ferries. Expect well under
an hour to get from the ferry harbors to Aalto University. Take trams
to the metro, but from each harbor walking to the metro is reasonable
(not too far and nice walks). (Some attendees are also attending the
Nordic e-infrastructure Conference in Tallinn on 27-29 May, they will
be taking ferries from Tallinn the evening of 29 May. More info to be
announced)</p>
<p><strong>Bus, Train, etc. within Finland:</strong> You probably know how to get to
the center of Helsinki. Follow public transit below.</p>
<p><strong>Private vehicle:</strong> There isn’t free parking, but there are paid lots
around.</p>
<p><strong>Public transport:</strong> The public transport system is good and easy to
use. The metro stop name is “Aalto University”, and the A exit is
closer to us. Tickets can be bought at ticket machines,
or via the “HSL App”. Aalto University is in the zone B, downtown is
in the zone A, the airport in zone C, and tickets last a bit more than
an hour and work on any public bus, train, metro, or tram (and as many
transfers as you need). AB zone tickets cost about 3€.</p>
<p>If coming from airport: use single tickets, day tickets not worth it
even with one extra trip to/from downtown.</p>
<p>Now, all tickets can be bought using contactless payment cards
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.hsl.fi/en/tickets-and-fares/contactless-payment">details</a>).
Select the appropriate zones (AB or ABC) at the blue readers (before
getting on the metro, after boarding bus/train/tram), then show your
card.  <a class="reference external" href="https://www.hsl.fi/en/tickets-and-fares">More info and ways to pay</a>.</p>

<section id="history-of-nobsc">
<h3>History of NoBSC<a class="headerlink" href="#history-of-nobsc" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>You could say this event was first inspired when Richard Darst went to
the <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170915060021/http://neic2017.nordforsk.org/">Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration conference in 2017</a>.
This event had a variety of infrastructure and open science people not
advertising why their stuff was so good, but discussion how to make
things better.  (At least that’s what it looks like with rose-colored
glasses looking back.)  This also kicked off the collaboration between
ASC and CodeRefinery (a NeIC project dedicated to teaching basic
software tools for researchers), which continues to this day.</p>
<p>CodeRefinery didn’t feel like a collaboration not between
organizations, but between the people in the trenches directly helping
or users.  This was an extremely productive collaboration, not just in
the main teaching but in connecting people together to talk about
their other jobs besides teaching.</p>
<p>In 2019, we had a meeting it Helsinki called <a class="reference external" href="https://nordichpc.github.io/2019-11-14-helsinki/">Nordic HPC</a>, basically a lot
of the CodeRefinery staff who were supporters of smaller
university-based computing clusters.  We enjoyed talking and sharing
ideas, but soon we became closer together because we were all working
online, and our <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.org/workshops/past/">collaboration was focused on online events</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in 2025, we are trying to meet again in person.  Hopefully there
are the best parts from NeIC conferences, NeIC all-hands meetings,
and NordicHPC, with even more people welcome to attend.</p>
<p>In addition to the SciComp team meetup, we have noticed that Research
Software Engineering community, or “researchers who code” appreciate
the connection to each other too - and there is a lot of connections
and career movement between the two groups.  Samantha’s fellowship
with the Software Sustainability Institute looks at exactly that.
Part of the fellowship is the contribution to the international RSE
survey to get to know the Finnish and Nordic community needs a bit
better.  A short lunch meeting of RSE enthusiasts in Espoo to
celebrate the international RSE day on October 9th 2025 was a good
start to connect. For the Finnish RSE meetup, we aim to also get
together RSE enthusiasts from all over the country, share what we do,
learn from each other and also learn about the needs and wishes of the
community.</p>

<p>Aalto Scientific Computing (ASC) invites you to its early 2026
meetup - a gathering of everyone interested in supporting scientific
computing (and a celebration of the diverse work that makes it all
possible). Aalto Otaniemi Campus, 2-4 February 2026.</p>
<p><strong>The first half is a</strong> <a class="reference internal" href="#document-finnish-rse-meetup"><span class="doc">Finnish+friends RSE meetup</span></a> <strong>, the second half is a</strong> <a class="reference internal" href="#document-rc-scicomp-team-meetup"><span class="doc">meetup of local
research and scientific computing teams more targeted to service staff</span></a><strong>.  The overlapping middle day has events
that are interesting to both audiences.  People are welcome to attend
both halves, but we expect many attendees will only attend one half or
the other.</strong></p>

<p>This isn’t a time to advertise how great our tools and services are.
It’s a time to look under the hood and talk about all the problems we
encountered on the way (and the problems we expect in the future) so
we can get better.</p>
<section id="topics">
<h2>Topics<a class="headerlink" href="#topics" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>You can submit talks/events, and also there will time for last-minute
“unconference” submissions.  We can talk about whatever is interesting
to us: from past achievements to future directions.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Academic experience as a research engineer.</p></li>
<li><p>Practical support (research software engineering, both practices and
how we run our teams).</p></li>
<li><p>HPC cluster management (day to day problems and usability for small
projects and new users); infrastructure usability.</p></li>
<li><p>Teaching and mentoring of our users (practical teaching done for the
previous two categories).</p></li>
<li><p>Our teams compared to giant national infrastructures; what is our
role?</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Day 0 (Su, 1 Feb 2026): If anyone arrives early, grilling dinner in a Finnish forest (if enough people want to brave the cold).</p></li>
<li><p>Day 1 (Mo, 2 Feb 2026): RSE meetup</p></li>
<li><p>Day 2 (Tu, 3 Feb 2026): RSE/SciComp overlap day: events, lunch, evening dinner, some social activities scattered between.</p></li>
<li><p>Day 3 (We: 4 Feb 2026): SciComp team meetup: events 9-12, lunch.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Example sessions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Plenty of time for <a class="reference internal" href="#document-call-for-sessions"><span class="doc">submitted events</span></a> and
networking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cool things and problems:</strong> each organization presents three cool
things they have done lately and three problems they are facing
right now.  This serves as a basis for networking during the rest of
the event.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Panel discussion with junior computational researchers</strong>: Panel
discussions are usually full of the most senior people the
organizers can find.  In this discussion, we’ll hear from junior
researchers, about how usable they find computing systems and the
onboarding process.</p></li>
