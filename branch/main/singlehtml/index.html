<section id="about-the-event">
<h3>About the event<a class="headerlink" href="#about-the-event" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This meetup is targeted towards people in local Scientific Computing
(SciComp)/Research computing/Research Software Engineer support teams,
for example university local HPC teams.  We work in local capacity and
are often overshadowed by the big national e-infrastructure providers
(CSC, EuroHPC, etc) in attention and funding, yet we are the ones “on
the ground” with the researchers.  What’s our place in the world?</p>
<p>We have our own unique challenges and opportunities.  This is a time
we can talk together and learn from each other.  (Others are of course
welcome.)  Maybe we can make a strategy for working together or
getting some national funding?</p>
</section>
<section id="who-should-join">
<h3>Who should join?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-should-join" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>For example, many of the teams that were part of the old Finnish Grid
Infrastructure at univerities or local partners of the CodeRefinery
collaboration.  Really, if you work with Aalto Scientific Computing
you are strongly invited and we’ll have some fun discussions.  If you
don’t, you are invited anyway.</p>
<p>Academic conferences usually don’t suit us, but we need a community.
Our job is important and challenging, and we can’t do it alone.  NoBSC
is the right level for the networking we need to succeed at our jobs.</p>
<p>In this first iteration, we especially welcome people who support
academic research through computing and data expertise in universities
and research institutions, for example those in local HPC or RSE
teams, cloud computing, and other computing services for
researchers. But everyone is welcome: including those who might want
these kind of jobs in the future.</p>

centralized.</p></li>
<li><p>Local services we run, how they compare to national services.</p></li>
<li><p>Advantages and disadvantages of being positioned locally.</p></li>
<li><p>What types of infrastructure funding we could apply for to increase
our benefit or make (inter-)national collaborations. (Dedicated

<p>There are various hotels within easy walking distance. We don’t have any particular discounts. “Radison Blu Otaniemi” is the default location for university visitors. Other hotels in Helsinki downtown are fine also, the metro trip is 11 minutes (and costs ~3 euros).</p>
</section>
<section id="arrival">
<h3>Arrival<a class="headerlink" href="#arrival" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>tldr: Aalto University is at the “Aalto University” metro stop. An
“ABC” ticket manages the train from airport AND metro (and trams,
busses, etc).</p>
<p><strong>Air:</strong> Helsinki Airport. Between the airport and Aalto University,
plan for max 1.5 hours (less than one hour is possible if you are
efficient). From the airport, follow signs to the train station. Board
a train and immediately use a contactless payment card to buy an ABC
ticket at a card reader; this will get you all the way to the
university (see public transport). Take the first train that comes
(either way gets to downtown in about the same time). From the main
station, walk to the connected metro station. Take a metro to the stop
Aalto University (direction Tapiola or Kivenlahti), then continue in
section “public transport” below.</p>
<p><strong>Ferry:</strong> From Tallinn or Stockholm, there are ferries. Expect well under
an hour to get from the ferry harbors to Aalto University. Take trams
to the metro, but from each harbor walking to the metro is reasonable
(not too far and nice walks). (Some attendees are also attending the
Nordic e-infrastructure Conference in Tallinn on 27-29 May, they will
be taking ferries from Tallinn the evening of 29 May. More info to be
announced)</p>
<p><strong>Bus, Train, etc. within Finland:</strong> You probably know how to get to
the center of Helsinki. Follow public transit below.</p>
<p><strong>Private vehicle:</strong> There isn’t free parking, but there are paid lots
around.</p>
<p><strong>Public transport:</strong> The public transport system is good and easy to
use. The metro stop name is “Aalto University”, and the A exit is
closer to us. Tickets can be bought at ticket machines,
or via the “HSL App”. Aalto University is in the zone B, downtown is
in the zone A, the airport in zone C, and tickets last a bit more than
an hour and work on any public bus, train, metro, or tram (and as many
transfers as you need). AB zone tickets cost about 3€.</p>
<p>If coming from airport: use single tickets, day tickets not worth it
even with one extra trip to/from downtown.</p>
<p>Now, all tickets can be bought using contactless payment cards
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.hsl.fi/en/tickets-and-fares/contactless-payment">details</a>).
Select the appropriate zones (AB or ABC) at the blue readers (before
getting on the metro, after boarding bus/train/tram), then show your
card.  <a class="reference external" href="https://www.hsl.fi/en/tickets-and-fares">More info and ways to pay</a>.</p>

<p>Attendees are expected to follow the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/aalto-university/code-of-conduct-values-into-practice">Aalto University code of conduct</a>.
Realisically you won’t read it, so here the general idea :</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>There will be attendees at a wide variety of points in their
RSE/SciComp career. Try to understand them and help them go.</p></li>
<li><p>There will be attendees who know more or fewer other attendees.
Take active steps to include them in your conversations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Leave spaces in your circle for others to join, if you see someone
hovering, invite them in and fill them in on what you are talking
about.</p></li>
<li><p>Give special attention to understanding who is in your discussion
groups and making sure you are talking at the right level.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>This is a bottom-up event to support your networking. Please help out if see something to improve and you
have time and ability.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell Richard or Samantha if you need something.</p></li>

<h3>History of NoBSC<a class="headerlink" href="#history-of-nobsc" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>You could say this event was first inspired when Richard Darst went to
the <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170915060021/http://neic2017.nordforsk.org/">Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration conference in 2017</a>.
This event had a variety of infrastructure and open science people not
advertising why their stuff was so good, but discussion how to make
things better.  (At least that’s what it looks like with rose-colored
glasses looking back.)  This also kicked off the collaboration between
ASC and CodeRefinery (a NeIC project dedicated to teaching basic
software tools for researchers), which continues to this day.</p>
<p>CodeRefinery didn’t feel like a collaboration not between
organizations, but between the people in the trenches directly helping
or users.  This was an extremely productive collaboration, not just in
the main teaching but in connecting people together to talk about
their other jobs besides teaching.</p>
<p>In 2019, we had a meeting it Helsinki called <a class="reference external" href="https://nordichpc.github.io/2019-11-14-helsinki/">Nordic HPC</a>, basically a lot
of the CodeRefinery staff who were supporters of smaller
university-based computing clusters.  We enjoyed talking and sharing
ideas, but soon we became closer together because we were all working
online, and our <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.org/workshops/past/">collaboration was focused on online events</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in 2025, we are trying to meet again in person.  Hopefully there
are the best parts from NeIC conferences, NeIC all-hands meetings,
and NordicHPC, with even more people welcome to attend.</p>
<p>In addition to the SciComp team meetup, we have noticed that Research
Software Engineering community, or “researchers who code” appreciate
the connection to each other too - and there is a lot of connections
and career movement between the two groups.  Samantha’s fellowship
with the Software Sustainability Institute looks at exactly that.
Part of the fellowship is the contribution to the international RSE
survey to get to know the Finnish and Nordic community needs a bit
better.  A short lunch meeting of RSE enthusiasts in Espoo to
celebrate the international RSE day on October 9th 2025 was a good
start to connect. For the Finnish RSE meetup, we aim to also get
together RSE enthusiasts from all over the country, share what we do,
learn from each other and also learn about the needs and wishes of the
community.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to submit talks, demos, or posters you’d like to present.</p>
<p>Our facilities include one main room (reserved), one breakout room (reserved),
and several informal spaces throughout the building’s lobby areas that can be used
for smaller discussion sessions (not reserved).</p>
<p><strong>Selection process:</strong>
We will review all submissions to make sure they align with the spirit of the event.
Our goal is to accept as many contributions as possible. If there are too many long talks submitted,
our plan is to let attendees vote and allocate time slots based on those votes.
When submitting, please keep your abstract concise and accessible to a general audience.</p>
<p>In short: Your contribution will most likely be accepted, the main question is how much time you’ll have to present.</p>
<p>Deadline for submissions to get into the program is January 20 end of day in Nordics.</p>
<p>You will get to know about the length of your talk on January 21.</p>

<p><strong>You are allowed to come with a question instead of a solution.</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Introduction to how my team/organization works.</p></li>
<li><p>Cool procedure/practice/tool we have developed.</p></li>
<li><p>Cool software I have developed.</p></li>
<li><p>Book/video/event review and summary.</p></li>
<li><p>Problem or concern I am facing now.</p></li>
<li><p>Demo or poster about something you would like to have input on.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can request how long your session should be: lightning talk (10 min),
20 min talk, poster/demo spot.
You will get to know your assigned length in time before the event.</p>

<h3>Unconference<a class="headerlink" href="#unconference" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>We’ll also set aside time for an unconference: sessions that can be proposed or requested
on the spot during the event. Maybe you’ll invite someone to run a session inspired by an
informal coffee conversation, or you’ll discover that several attendees are curious to hear
more about something you’re working on.
The unconference time is meant exactly for those spontaneous, interest-driven sessions.</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Sharing GIS Tools Across Disciplines: Hard Choices, opportunities, and Trade-offs
  <a class="headerlink" href="#kamyar" title="Link to this heading"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>Contributors: Kamyar Hasanzadeh</i></li>
<li><i>Time, Location: 13:30, Palaver</i></li>
</ul>

<p>As GIS methods spread into interdisciplinary research, researchers are increasingly expected to package their workflows as usable software for others. In practice, this is far from straightforward. This talk reflects on several common ways of sharing GIS tools—commercial extensions (e.g. ArcGIS toolboxes), open-source plugins (QGIS), standalone desktop applications, web apps, and simply releasing code—and the challenges that come with each. These include technical maintenance, licensing constraints, usability for non-GIS experts, reproducibility, institutional dependencies, and long-term sustainability. Rather than advocating a single solution, the talk examines both the advantages and the challenges of each approach, using these trade-offs as a starting point for discussion on how researchers and research software engineers can make more realistic and context-aware decisions when sharing GIS methods for interdisciplinary use.</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">TargetCAT: When a Script Refuses to Stay Small
  <a class="headerlink" href="#ina" title="Link to this heading"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>Contributors: Ina Pöhner, Rafael Lopes Almeida</i></li>
<li><i>Time, Location: 13:30, Palaver</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine a project where a handful of researchers all try to do the same thing - except everyone does it manually, in their own way, and the one automated step crashes regularly due to poor error handling. Out of frustration with this fragile setup, TargetCAT was born. What began as a small collection of personal scripts to manage and process data on potential drug targets refused to stay small. It quietly turned into a research pipeline that enabled several publications and projects, while itself remaining far from ideal in many places.</p><p>In this talk, we use TargetCAT as a case study to explore how research software typically evolves in academic projects: how it survives, grows, and gradually accumulates technical debt. We reflect on familiar patterns such as ad‑hoc workflows, "ghost development" carried out outside funded time, and feature creep driven by scientific needs without corresponding resources. Along the way, the story touches on identity challenges faced by researchers whose work is effectively research software engineering, but is assessed through publication‑centred metrics.</p><p>The second half of the talk turns to a reboot of TargetCAT as an open‑source pipeline for an academic–industry collaboration. In this part, we share how earlier missteps and constraints, together with a fresh developer perspective and a conscious commitment to RSE practices from the outset, are shaping its second life. We conclude by teasing lessons learned and opening a discussion on how academic projects might better plan, fund, and recognise software work - and how this could support more sustainable, RSE‑centric career paths.</p>

<li><i>Time, Location: 09:30, Palaver</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Jeremy Cohen is an Advanced Research Fellow in the Department of Computing and Director of Research Software Engineering Strategy at Imperial College London. He has been involved in the Research Software Engineering community since the early days and held a research software development role in a research group prior to the existence of the “RSE" term. He has a PhD in Computing from Imperial and held one of the 5-year Research Software Engineering Fellowships (from 2018) that were funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). Jeremy is currently involved in a set of different grants relating to RSE and the wider “digital Research Technical Professionals” (dRTP) space that’s developing in the UK to recognise not just RSEs but also research data and research computing infrastructure professionals. He is the PI of STEP-UP (https://step-up.ac.uk), an EPSRC-funded Strategic Technical Platform with a regional focus on developing skills, community and career pathways for dRTPs.</p><p>In his talk, Jeremy will discuss how Research Software Engineering has developed within the UK. He will highlight various challenges and opportunities around developing skills and career pathways for RSEs. He will then look at how the RSE community is expanding to represent a wider group of dRTPs in a range of technical roles who provide vital contributions to support and undertake modern digital research.</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Towards FAIR file formats: a case example with Origin & Python
  <a class="headerlink" href="#julia" title="Link to this heading"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>Contributors: Julia Niskanen</i></li>
<li><i>Time, Location: 10:45, Palaver</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Open science and FAIR principles have become increasingly important in the last decade. However, the implementation of Interoperability is sometimes challenged by established software and analytical practices. One example of such established software is Origin (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, Massachusetts, USA), an analysis software with various features involving graphing, statistical operations, and data processing and transformation. Origin output files are comprehensive and can contain entire analysis pipelines; however, the file format (.opju) is proprietary, the software is restricted to Windows and requires a paid license to access all features, and there is no easy option to export all the contents of the file to other formats. Together, these factors impede the implementation of Interoperability. To overcome these obstacles, I have developed a lightweight Python tool, convert-opju, that can be run within Origin to quickly and systematically export graphs, images, workbooks, matrices and notes to open file formats. While not all objects of the .opju file are currently included, converting the major objects to open formats is a notable improvement to Interoperability. Convert-opju is freely available (MIT License) on Github and Zenodo.</p>

<p>SymPy looks nice, but it's not a real CAS... is it? In this presentation I hope to show that as well as SymPy scaling down, SymPy is quite a capable CAS for helping to tackle real world problems we might encounter as RSEs. The main content of the presentation is a case study of how SymPy has been a useful tool during my first project as an RSE, working on a simulation of a mass spectrometer, both as a tool for ad-hoc tool enabling DRY and --- using more of its power --- to help design more efficient numerical sampling code. So next time you have some maths to wrangle, I say: "Go on: treat yourself!" (to SymPy)</p>

<p>We often hear clear-cut instructions about legal matters in research (copyright, data, ethics, intellectual property, and especially AI these days).  Yet humans are behind the scenes, reading and interpreting the legislation, court cases and legal literature and producing these guidelines, and it isn't always so clear-cut.  This is a discussion with Maria Rehbinder, Legal Counsel, Aalto University, where we'll peek "behind the curtains" at some of the open questions going around right now, especially related to AI.  This will start a two-way discussion about all of these legal matters.</p><p>Maria Rehbinder is a Senior Legal Counsel at Aalto University.  Her traditional standard projects included copyright, trademarks, and design rights, but more recently has been involved in the initial implementation work of legislation such as the GDPR, AI Act, and Digital Services Act.  Maria serves as a member in the Copyright Commission and the Copyright Council of the Ministry of Education and Culture and as a member in the Rights Management Committee of Open Research and Science 2014-2017 initiative of the ministry.</p>

<p>We don't know if anyone will be interested in discussing this. If there is no explicit requests, it is safe to assume this won't happen.</p><p>How can universities get infrastructure funding for local Research Software Engineer support.  How can they work together? This is a discussion, taking into account everything we have learned at the workshop, to make some plans on what comes next. Can we apply as a Finnish Research Infrastructure?  Can we form an international NeIC project for this?  Any EU opportunities?  Is it better to start local?  With large computing clusters taking all the hype, what's the role of local people?  We will try to figure this out.</p>
