Scientific computing team meetup
================================

About the event
---------------

This meetup is targeted towards people in local Scientific Computing
(SciComp)/Research computing/Research Software Engineer support teams,
for example university local HPC teams.  We work in local capacity and
are often overshadowed by the big national e-infrastructure providers
(CSC, EuroHPC, etc) in attention and funding, yet we are the ones "on
the ground" with the researchers.  What's our place in the world?

We have our own unique challenges and opportunities.  This is a time
we can talk together and learn from each other.  (Others are of course
welcome.)  Maybe we can make a strategy for working together or
getting some national funding?


Who should join?
----------------

For example, many of the teams that were part of the old Finnish Grid
Infrastructure at univerities or local partners of the CodeRefinery
collaboration.  Really, if you work with Aalto Scientific Computing
you are strongly invited and we'll have some fun discussions.  If you
don't, you are invited anyway.

Academic conferences usually don't suit us, but we need a community.
Our job is important and challenging, and we can't do it alone.  NoBSC
is the right level for the networking we need to succeed at our jobs.

In this first iteration, we especially welcome people who support
academic research through computing and data expertise in universities
and research institutions, for example those in local HPC or RSE
teams, cloud computing, and other computing services for
researchers. But everyone is welcome: including those who might want
these kind of jobs in the future.


Program ideas
-------------

We can especially talk about:

* Local resources and teams in a time when computing is becoming more
  centralized.
* Local services we run, how they compare to national services.
* Advantages and disadvantages of being positioned locally.
* What types of infrastructure funding we could apply for to increase
  our benefit or make (inter-)national collaborations. (Dedicated
  session: Wednesday afternoon)
