Research/scientific computing team meetup
=========================================

About the Event
---------------

This meetup is targeted towards people in SciComp/Research computing
support teams, for example university local HPC teams.  We work in
local capacity without the big national e-infrastructure providers,
and have our own unique challenges and opportunities.  This is a time
we can talk together and learn from each other.  (Others are of course
welcome.)

Who should join?
----------------

For example, many of the teams that were part of the old Finnish Grid
Infrastructure at univerities or local partners of the CodeRefinery
collaboration.  Really, if you work with Aalto Scientific Computing
you are strongly invited and we'll have some fun.  If you don't, you
are invited anyway.

We especially welcome people who support academic research through
computing and data expertise in universities and research institutions
, for example those in local HPC or RSE teams, cloud computing, and
other computing services for researchers. But everyone is welcome:
including Academic researchers, data managers, open science experts
and anyone interested in these topics.


Program ideas
-------------

We can especially talk about:

* Local resources and teams in a time when computing is becoming more
  centralized.
* Local services we run, advantages we find with being positioned
  locally.
* What types of infrastructure funding we could apply for in the
  modern climate. (Dedicated session: Wednesday afternoon)


Organizers
----------

Richard Darst is mainly focused on this half.
