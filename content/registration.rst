Registration
============

There is no registration fee, but also no food, snacks, coffe, and
dinner provided.  We will have to divide into smaller groups for lunch
and dinners and distribute to various restaurants.  We will provide
long times for coffee breaks and lunches and make sure that everyone
can find an engaging group to be a part of.

Maximum capicity 50 but ideal size 30.

Online attendiance will probably be possible, but we havn't set it up
yet.

Code of conduct
---------------

Attendees are expected to follow the `Aalto University code of conduct
<https://www.aalto.fi/en/aalto-university/code-of-conduct-values-into-practice>`__.
Realisically you won't read it, but the general idea is in the next
section:

Discussion starters
-------------------

* There will be attendees at a wide variety of points in their
  RSE/SciComp career.  Understand them and help them go.

* There will be attendees who know more or fewer other attendees.
  Take active steps to include them in your conversations:

  * Leave spaces in your circle for others to join, if you see someone
    hovering, invite them in and fill them in on what you are talking
    about.

  * Give special attention to understanding who is in your discussion
    groups and making sure you are talking at the right level.

* There is no major funding or supporter.  Please help out if you
  have time and ability.

* Tell the organizers (Richard and Samantha, or anyone else) if you
  need something.
