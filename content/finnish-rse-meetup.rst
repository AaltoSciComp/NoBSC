Finnish (+ friends) RSE Meetup
==============================

About the Event
---------------

The Finnish and friends RSE (Research Software Engineer) Meetup brings together people in Finland (and beyond) who develop or support research through software, data, and computing. Whether your title is RSE, scientist, data specialist, or IT support, if you’re helping research through code or computational tools - this event is for you. This is also for you, the RSE enthusiast, who enjoys the coding part of research work more or just as much as the research part. 

Why a Finnish RSE Meetup?
-------------------------

While Nordic-RSE connects the regional community, this Finnish meetup provides a national focus for collaboration and sharing. It helps us:

- Discuss challenges and opportunities specific to Finnish institutions and funding structures
- Strengthen local networks and identify national needs (training, recognition, career paths)
- Coordinate efforts between universities, research institutes, and infrastructure providers like CSC

This meetup complements the Nordic-RSE community by creating a space for practical cooperation within Finland, while staying connected to the wider Nordic and international RSE movements.

Who Should Join
---------------

- Researchers and research software engineers developing or maintaining research code
- Data and computing specialists supporting research workflows
- IT staff, educators, and research managers interested in improving research software practices
- Early-career researchers curious about RSE career paths

No formal RSE title is needed - if you develop, or support research software, you belong here.

Why Participate
---------------

By joining, you can:

- Meet peers from across Finnish universities and research institutes
- Learn how RSE groups and initiatives are organized in Finland
- Share your own experiences, needs, and ideas for national cooperation
- Help shape the future of Finnish/Nordic RSE activities - training, recognition, and community events

Travel funding
