History of NoBSC
----------------

You could say this event was first inspired when Richard Darst went to
the `Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration conference in 2017
<https://web.archive.org/web/20170915060021/http://neic2017.nordforsk.org/>`__.
This event had a variety of infrastructure and open science people not
advertising why their stuff was so good, but discussion how to make
things better.  (At least that's what it looks like with rose-colored
glasses looking back.)  This also kicked off the collaboration between
ASC and CodeRefinery (a NeIC project dedicated to teaching basic
software tools for researchers), which continues to this day.

CodeRefinery didn't feel like a collaboration not between
organizations, but between the people in the trenches directly helping
or users.  This was an extremely productive collaboration, not just in
the main teaching but in connecting people together to talk about
their other jobs besides teaching.

In 2019, we had a meeting it Helsinki called `Nordic HPC
<https://nordichpc.github.io/2019-11-14-helsinki/>`__, basically a lot
of the CodeRefinery staff who were supporters of smaller
university-based computing clusters.  We enjoyed talking and sharing
ideas, but soon we became closer together because we were all working
online, and our `collaboration was focused on online events
<https://coderefinery.org/workshops/past/>`__.

Now, in 2025, we are trying to meet again in person.  Hopefully there
are the best parts from NeIC conferences, NeIC all-hands meetings,
and NordicHPC, with even more people welcome to attend.

In addition to the SciComp team meetup, we have noticed that Research
Software Engineering community, or "researchers who code" appreciate
the connection to each other too - and there is a lot of connections
and career movement between the two groups.  Samantha's fellowship
with the Software Sustainability Institute looks at exactly that.
Part of the fellowship is the contribution to the international RSE
survey to get to know the Finnish and Nordic community needs a bit
better.  A short lunch meeting of RSE enthusiasts in Espoo to
celebrate the international RSE day on October 9th 2025 was a good
start to connect. For the Finnish RSE meetup, we aim to also get
together RSE enthusiasts from all over the country, share what we do,
learn from each other and also learn about the needs and wishes of the
community.
