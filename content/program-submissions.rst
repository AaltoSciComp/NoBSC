Program Submissions
===================

Everyone is asked to contribute to "cool things and problems".

Remember, the theme of this conference is how we actually work and
"how the sausage is made", not "advertising our sausage".  You can
present ideas, undone things, things you need advice on, and so on.
You can request lightning talks, short talks, long talks, breakout
sessions, discussions, etc.

**Submissions will open later.**


Submit an event
---------------

You'll be able to submit talks/demos/workshops/etc. you'd like to give.

Our facilities include one main room (reserved), one breakout room
(reserved), and various other places you can find in the building
lobby areas for smaller discussion sessions (not reserved).


Request an event
----------------

If you have things you would like to hear/do, but can't organize
yourself, please submit this as part of your registration or via the
submission form and we'll see if we can find someone to present.
We'll probably contact all registrants to see who can take one of
them.
