Call for sessions
=================

Everyone is asked to contribute to "cool things and problems".

Remember, the theme of this conference is how we actually work and
"the problems we found along the way", not "advertising our product".
You can present ideas, what you couldn't do, things you need advice
on, and so on.  You can request time slots for lightning talks, short
talks, long talks, breakout sessions, discussions, etc.

**Submissions will open later.**


Submit a session
----------------

You'll be able to submit talks/demos/workshops/etc. you'd like to give.

Our facilities include one main room (reserved), one breakout room
(reserved), and various other places you can find in the building
lobby areas for smaller discussion sessions (not reserved).


Session inspirations
--------------------

**You are allowed to come with a question instead of a solution.**

* Introduction to how my team/organization works.
* Cool procedure/practice/tool we have developed.
* Cool software I have developed.
* Book/video/event review and summary.
* Problem or concern I am facing now.
* Demo and/or hack times.

You can say how long your session should be: lightning talk (5 min),
30 min, longer breakout discussion/workshop.  You can submit multiple
events and your priority for each.


Cool things and problems
------------------------

Everyone will have a chance to (and be encouraged) to contribute to
the session "Cool things and problems".  In this, each team presents
three cool things they are doing, and three problems they are facing.
We can then see.


Unconference
------------

We will also save some time for an "unconference": sessions request
right during the conference.  Perhaps you'll ask someone to make a
session based on informal discussions.


Request a session
-----------------

If you have things you would like to hear/do, but can't organize
yourself, please submit this as part of your registration or via the
submission form and we'll see if we can find someone to present.
We'll probably contact all registrants to see who can take one of
them.
