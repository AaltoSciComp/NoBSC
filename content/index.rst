Aalto Scientific Computing (ASC) invites you to its early 2026
meetup - a gathering of everyone interested in supporting scientific
computing (and a celebration of the diverse work that makes it all
possible). Aalto Otaniemi Campus, 2-4 February 2026.

**The first half is a "Finnish RSE meetup", the second half is "NoBSC"
and more targeted to service staff.  The middle day has events that
are interesting to both audiences.  People can attend both halves, but
we expect many attendees will only attend one half or the other.**

**Who is this for?** We especially welcome people who support academic
research through computing and data expertise in universities and
research institutions , for example those in local HPC or RSE teams,
cloud computing, and other computing services for researchers. But
everyone is welcome: including Academic researchers, data managers,
open science experts and anyone interested in these topics.

This isn't a time to advertise how great our sausage is.  It's a time
to talk about how our sausage is made (the good and bad things) so we
can all get better at it.

Topics
------

We can talk about whatever is interesting to us: from past
achievements, to future directions.

* Practical support (research software engineering, both practices and
  how we run our teams),
* HPC cluster management (day to day problems and usability for small
  projects and new users)
* Teaching (practical teaching done for the previous two categories)


Schedule (general plan)
-----------------------

* Day 0 (Su, 1 Feb 2026): If anyone arrives early, grilling dinner in a Finnish forest (if enough people want to brave the cold).
* Day 1 (Mo, 2 Feb 2026): Finnish RSE meetup
* Day 2 (Tu, 3 Feb 2026): RSE/NoBSC day: events, lunch, evening dinner, some social activities scattered between.
* Day 3 (We: 4 Feb 2026): events 9-12, lunch.

Sessions known so far:

* Plenty of time for :doc:`submitted events <program-submissions>` and
  networking.

* **Cool things and problems:** each organization presents three cool
  things they have done lately and three problems they are facing
  right now.  This serves as a basis for networking during the rest of
  the event.

* **Panel discussion with junior computational researchers**: Panel
  discussions are usually full of the most senior people the
  organizers can find.  In this discussion, we'll hear from junior
  researchers, about how usable they find computing systems and the
  onboarding process.
