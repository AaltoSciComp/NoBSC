Nordic Basic Scientific Computing 2026
======================================

Aalto Scientific Computing (ASC) invites you to its early 2026
meetup - a gathering of everyone interested in supporting scientific
computing (and a celebration of the diverse work that makes it all
possible).  2026 February 2-4.

**Who is this for?** We especially welcome people who support academic
research through computing and data expertise in universities and
research institutions , for example those in local HPC or RSE teams,
cloud computing, and other computing services for researchers. But
everyone is welcome: including Academic researchers, data managers,
open science experts and anyone interested in these topics.

This isn't a time to advertise how great our sausage is.  It's a time
to talk about how our sausage is made (the good and bad things) so we
can all get better at it.

Topics
------

We can talk about whatever is interesting to us: from past
achievements, to future directions.

* Practical support (research software engineering, both practices and
  how we run our teams),
* HPC cluster management (day to day problems and usability for small
  projects and new users)
* Teaching (practical teaching done for the previous two categories)


Schedule (general plan)
-----------------------

* Day 0 (Su, 1 Feb 2026): If anyone arrives early, grilling dinner in a Finnish forest.
* Day 1 (Mo, 2 Feb 2026): Finnish RSE meetup
* Day 2 (Tu, 3 Feb 2026): RSE/NoBSC day: events, lunch, evening dinner, some social activities scattered between.
* Day 3 (We: 4 Feb 2026): events 9-12, lunch.

Sessions:

* **Cool things and problems:** each organization presents three cool
  things they have done lately and three problems they are facing
  right now.  This serves as a basis for networking during the rest of
  the event.
