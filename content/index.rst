Nordic Basic Scientific Computing is a gathering of everyone
interested in supporting scientific computing (and a celebration of
the diverse work that makes it all possible).  Aalto Scientific
Computing invites to its homebased at Otaniemi Campus, 2-4
February 2026.

**The first half is a** :doc:`Finnish+friends RSE meetup
<finnish-rse-meetup>` **, the second half is a** :doc:`meetup of Finnish
scientific computing teams more targeted to service staff
<scicomp-team-meetup>`\ **.  The overlapping middle day has events
that are interesting to both audiences.  People are welcome to attend
both halves.**

This isn't a time to advertise how great we are.  It's a time to look
under the hood and talk about what's really going on, so that we can
do a better job in the future.  If your job is "getting stuff done"
instead of "publishing papers" and you want to learn from like-minded
people, this is the meeting for you.

  We will provide
long times for coffee breaks and lunches and make sure that everyone
