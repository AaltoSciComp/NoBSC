Nordic Basic Scientific Computing is a gathering of everyone
interested in supporting scientific computing (and a celebration of
the diverse work that makes it all possible).  Aalto Scientific
Computing invites you to its homebase at Otaniemi Campus, 2-4
February 2026.

This event is split into two halves: 
**The first half is a** :doc:`Finnish+friends RSE meetup
<finnish-rse-meetup>` **, the second half is a** :doc:`meetup of Finnish
scientific computing teams more targeted to service staff
<scicomp-team-meetup>`\ **.  The overlapping middle day has events
that are interesting to both audiences.  People are welcome to attend
both halves.**

This event focuses on practical discussion and experience-sharing in the world of RSE and SciComp. Whether you develop research software, support researchers through local computing services or you are simply curious about these roles, this is gathering for you. It’s a time to roll up our sleeves, look under the hood and talk about what’s really going on.

Registration
============

We will provide
long times for coffee breaks and lunches and make sure that everyone
can find an engaging group to be a part of.

The event is intended to be relatively small to facilitate networking.

Online attendance: We've chosen to hold this event in person only, as
we believe it offers the best environment for meaningful networking
and a more engaging, collaborative atmosphere.
