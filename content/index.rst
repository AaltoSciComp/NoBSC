Aalto Scientific Computing (ASC) invites you to its early 2026
meetup - a gathering of everyone interested in supporting scientific
computing (and a celebration of the diverse work that makes it all
possible). Aalto Otaniemi Campus, 2-4 February 2026.

**The first half is a** :doc:`Finnish+friends RSE meetup
<finnish-rse-meetup>` **, the second half is a** :doc:`meetup of local
unit research and scientific computing teams more targeted to service
staff <rc-scicomp-team-meetup>`\ **.  The overlapping middle day has
events that are interesting to both audiences.  People are welcome to
attend both halves, but we expect many attendees will only attend one
half or the other.**

This isn't a time to advertise how great our tools and services are.
It's a time to look under the hood and talk about all the problems we
encountered on the way (and the problems we expect in the future) so
we can get better.


Topics
------

You can submit talks/events, and also there will time for last-minute
"unconference" submissions.  We can talk about whatever is interesting
to us: from past achievements to future directions.

* Academic experience as a research engineer.
* Practical support (research software engineering, both practices and
  how we run our teams).
* HPC cluster management (day to day problems and usability for small
  projects and new users); infrastructure usability.
* Teaching and mentoring of our users (practical teaching done for the
  previous two categories).
* Our teams compared to giant national infrastructures; what is our
  role?


Schedule (general plan)
-----------------------

.. seealso:: :doc:`schedule`

* Day 0 (Su, 1 Feb 2026): If anyone arrives early, grilling dinner in a Finnish forest (if enough people want to brave the cold).
* Day 1 (Mo, 2 Feb 2026): RSE meetup
* Day 2 (Tu, 3 Feb 2026): RSE/SciComp overlap day: events, lunch, evening dinner, some social activities scattered between.
* Day 3 (We: 4 Feb 2026): SciComp team meetup: events 9-12, lunch.

Example sessions:

* Plenty of time for :doc:`submitted events <call-for-sessions>` and
  networking.

* **Cool things and problems:** each organization presents three cool
  things they have done lately and three problems they are facing
  right now.  This serves as a basis for networking during the rest of
  the event.

* **Panel discussion with junior computational researchers**: Panel
  discussions are usually full of the most senior people the
  organizers can find.  In this discussion, we'll hear from junior
  researchers, about how usable they find computing systems and the
  onboarding process.
