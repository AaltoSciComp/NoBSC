        Our icebreaker of the workshop, and starting point for sharing
        ideas.  Everyone (hopefully grouped into teams from their
        organization) can present one slide of three cool things they have
        done lately, and one slide of three problems they are facing
        lately.  We will quickly go through these and use the talk as a
        starting point for discussion - maybe a few unconference talks
        can be requested from it.

        The session will be built from a shared editable slide deck.
        Attendees will get contribution instructions (+ more details)
        closer to the event.

        What is the role of Research Software Engineers, and teams of them, in
        universities in the future?  Heikki Manilla was president of the
        Research Council of Finland (then the Academy of Finland) from
        2012-2022 and now the director of the "House of AI", an Aalto project
        helping to connect various disciplines in the use of AI and scientific
        computing.  Heikki will present the funders' side of things and give
        some vision for how research engineer and scientific computing teams
        can be made sustainable in the future.

      title: "Discussion: The current hardest legal questions in research data and computing"
      time: 15:45
      location: main
      abstract: |
        We often hear clear-cut instructions about legal matters in research
        (copyright, data, ethics, intellectual property, and especially AI
        these days).  Yet humans are behind the scenes, reading and
        interpreting the legislation, court cases and legal literature and
        producing these guidelines, and it isn't always so clear-cut.  This is
        a discussion with Maria Rehbinder, Legal Counsel, Aalto University,
        where we'll peek "behind the cutains" at some of the open questions
        going around right now, especially related to AI.  This will start a
        two-way discussion about all of these legal matters.

        Maria Rehbinder is a Senior Legal Counsel at Aalto University.  Her
        traditional standard projects included copyright, trademarks, and
        design rights, but more recently has been involved in the initial
        implementation work of legislation such as the GDPR, AI Act, and
        Digital Services Act.  Maria serves as a member in the Copyright
        Commission and the Copyright Council of the Ministry of Education and
        Culture and as a member in the Rights ManagementCommittee of Open
        Research and Science 2014-2017 initiative of the ministry.

        Panel discussions are usually full of the most senior people
        the organizers can find.  In this discussion, we'll hear from
        junior researchers, about how usable they find computing
        systems and the onboarding process.

      abstract: |
        How can universities get infrastructure funding for local
        Research Software Engineer support.  How can they work together?
        This is a discussion, taking into account everything we have
        learned at the workshop, to make some plans on what comes next.
        Can we apply as a Finnish Research Infrastructure?  Can we
        form an international NeIC project for this?  Any EU
        opportunities?  Is it better to start local?  With large
        computing clusters taking all the hype, what's the role of
        local people?  We will try to figure this out.
