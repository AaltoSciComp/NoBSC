        Our icebreaker of the workshop, and starting point for sharing
        ideas.  Everyone (hopefully grouped into teams from their
        organization) can present one slide of three cool things they have
        done lately, and one slide of three problems they are facing
        lately.  We will quickly go through these and use the talk as a
        starting point for discussion - maybe a few unconference talks
        can be requested from it.

        The session will be built from a shared editable slide deck.
        Attendees will get contribution instructions (+ more details)
        closer to the event.

    #    At least some sessions will be reserved for an unconference:
    #    open times when anyone may offer to present an ad-hoc talk,
    #    demo, discussion, etc.  These ideas may come from other
    #    discussions at the event.

        Panel discussions are usually full of the most senior people
        the organizers can find.  In this discussion, we'll hear from
        junior researchers, about how usable they find computing
        systems and the onboarding process.

      abstract: |
        How can universities get infrastructure funding for local
        Research Software Engineer support.  How can they work together?
        This is a discussion, taking into account everything we have
        learned at the workshop, to make some plans on what comes next.
        Can we apply as a Finnish Research Infrastructure?  Can we
        form an international NeIC project for this?  Any EU
        opportunities?  Is it better to start local?  With large
        computing clusters taking all the hype, what's the role of
        local people?  We will try to figure this out.

        Time: the last day after lunch.
